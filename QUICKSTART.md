        password: 'customer123'

## ⚡ Quick Tips

1. **Menu items auto-save** - When you add an item as a shopkeeper, it's saved to localStorage
2. **Refresh doesn't lose data** - Your menu persists across page refreshes
3. **Multiple browsers isolate data** - Each browser has separate localStorage
4. **Demo accounts are hardcoded** - You can change them in login.html

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Q: Items not saving?**
- Check if browser allows localStorage
- Try a different browser
- Clear browser cache and reload

**Q: Login not working?**
- Verify email matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check password is typed correctly
- Use demo credentials provided

**Q: Data disappeared?**
- Check you're on same browser/device
- Don't use private/incognito mode
- Try clearing cache (may lose data)
