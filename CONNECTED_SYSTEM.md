## 💾 Data Storage Details

### localStorage Keys Used:

```javascript
// Each shop has its own menu
localStorage.setItem(`shop_menu_${shopName}`, JSON.stringify(items))

// Examples:
"shop_menu_Captain Cuisine" → [item1, item2, ...]
"shop_menu_Utopia" → [item1, item2, ...]
"shop_menu_La Pinoz Pizza" → [item1, item2, ...]
```

### What's Stored:

```javascript
{
  id: 1234567890,              // Timestamp ID
  name: "Biryani",             // Item name
  price: 150,                  // Price in rupees
  category: "Main Course",     // Category
  description: "Delicious",    // Description
  available: true              // Availability status
}
```

---

## 🔧 How It Works Behind The Scenes

### **Shopkeeper Adds Item:**
```
1. User enters "Biryani", price "150"
2. JavaScript creates object with unique ID
3. Saves to localStorage: shop_menu_Captain Cuisine
4. UI refreshes immediately
```

### **Customer Browses Menu:**
```
1. Clicks "Captain Cuisine" on index.html
2. JavaScript checks localStorage for shop_menu_Captain Cuisine
3. If found (shopkeeper edited) → shows custom menu
4. If not found → shows default menu
5. Customer adds items to cart
```

### **Admin Views Changes:**
```
1. Loads all 56 canteens
2. Checks localStorage for each shop_menu_* key
3. Shows which shops have custom menus
4. Can view detailed menu for each shop
5. Generates reports with statistics
```

## 🎓 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. **shopkeeper.html** - Shop selection + real-time editing
2. **script.js** - Menu loaded from localStorage
3. **admin.html** - View all menus

### New Features:
- Shop dropdown in shopkeeper dashboard
- Menu storage per shop (not global)
- Admin menu viewer
- Real-time sync across pages

### Backward Compatible:
- Existing canteens still work
- Default menus still available
- No breaking changes

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **Shop Selection Required:**
- Shopkeeper MUST select a shop before editing
- Shop selection is persistent (saved in localStorage)
- Can change shop anytime from the selected shop display

### **Menu Updates:**
- Each shop has separate menu storage
- Updates from one shop don't affect others
- Customer sees combined view (custom + default)

### **Data Persistence:**
- Refreshing pages keeps all data
- Closing browser keeps data
- Using private/incognito mode will lose data
- Different browsers have separate storage
